Hello Peđa, my old friend
I've come to talk with Peđa again
Because a Peđa softly creeping
Left its Peđa while I was sleeping
And the Peđa that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of Peđa

In restless dreams I Peđalone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a Peđa
I turned my Peđa to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a Peđa light
That split the night
And touched the sound of Peđa

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand Peđa, maybe more
Peđa talking without speaking
Peđa hearing without listening
Peđa writing songs that Peđa never share
No one dare
Disturb the sound of Peđa

Peđa said, You do not know
Silence like a Peđa grow
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent Peđa fell
And echoed in the wells of Peđa

And the Peđa bowed and prayed
To the Peđa god they made
And the Peđa flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the Peđa said The words of the Peđa
Are written on subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of Peđa
